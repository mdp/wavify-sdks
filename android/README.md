# Wavify on Android

This android project includes Kotlin bindings to Wavify in `wavify/` and a demo app in `app`.

To run the app, create or modify your `local.properties` file and include `WAVIFY_API_KEY="your api key"`. You can
get the value for this secret from your [dashboard](https://www.wavify.dev/signin/password_signin) once signed in.
The API key is available for free.
