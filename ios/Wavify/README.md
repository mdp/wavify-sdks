# Wavify on iOS

This Swift project includes Swift bindings to Wavify in `Lib/` and a demo app in `Wavify/`.

To run the app, create the config file `Secrets.xcconfig` in `Wavify` and include `WAVIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key`. You can
get the value for this secret from your [dashboard](https://www.wavify.dev/signin/password_signin) once signed in.
The API key is available for free.
